# Minecraft Crafting

This is a simple project that gets crafting recipes under the form of images from the [Minecraft Crafting](https://www.minecraftcrafting.info/) website.

## Usage

To integrate this into your code, simply get an input from a user under the form of a Minecraft item name. Then, simply insert that value into the [one and only file](https://github.com/ThaZeno/mc-damage/blob/main/crafting-recipe.js) in this repo and get the link for the crafting image you've searched for. 

## Extras

• Feel free to use this code in any way you feel appropriate, even for commercial uses. 
• It's obvious that this code could be optimized to negate errors due to misspelling or the item formatting on the website, but this is one of the simplest ways of almost reliably retrieving these images.
